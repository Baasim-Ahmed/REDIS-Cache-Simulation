# REDIS-Cache-Simulation


This repository contains a C++ implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache system. The system incorporates three different data structures for caching:

<br>

Linked List (LRU_LL) : A linked list implementation for caching with basic operations such as Get, Put, Remove, and Display.

Binary Search Tree (LRU_BST) : A binary search tree implementation for caching with features like Insert, Delete, Search, and Display.

Hash Map (LRU_HM) : An implementation using a hash map for caching with capabilities like Insert, Search, Remove, and Display.

## 1. FEATURES

<br>

LRU Cache Implementations: Three different LRU cache implementations catering to diverse data structures.

User Interaction: Console-based menus allowing users to interact with and test each type of LRU cache.

<br>

## 2. PREREQUISITES

<br>

C++ compiler

Terminal or Command Prompt for execution

<br>

## 3. USAGE

<br>

Clone the repository to your local machine.

git clone https://github.com/your-username/REDIS-Cache-Simulation.git

Compile the code using a C++ compiler.

<br>

## 4. CODE OVERVIEW

<br>

The code provides implementations for three types of LRU cachesâ€”linked list, binary search tree, and hash map. Each cache type has its own set of operations and features.

<br>
